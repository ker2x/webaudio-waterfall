# Code Review: WebAudio Waterfall Spectrogram

Date: 2025-09-03
Reviewer: Automated review by Junie (JetBrains)

## Summary
Overall, the project is a clean, dependency-free Web Audio + Canvas application. The main logic resides in `js/app.js`, which contains:
- Waterfall renderer with offscreen canvas for efficient scrolling.
- AudioEngine that reads AnalyserNode byte frequency data and maps to normalized magnitudes.
- UI builder that dynamically constructs controls and wires events.

The code is readable, reasonably commented, and uses modern browser APIs. A few minor formatting issues and missing semicolons were fixed.

## Architecture
- Separation of concerns is acceptable: rendering (Waterfall), audio acquisition/processing (AudioEngine), and UI glue (startApp + buildUI).
- State management is lightweight and mostly local to instances. Settings persistence via localStorage is simple and effective.
- The app avoids heavy frameworks which keeps load time small.

## Code Quality
Strengths:
- Clear method responsibilities; self-explanatory function names.
- Inline documentation for key classes and functions.
- Uses requestAnimationFrame and a decimation parameter to control render cadence.

Areas to improve:
- Some magic numbers for axis spacing and bounds (e.g., 22px axis height, 48px right margin, 16 kHz clamp) could be centralized as constants.
- The color map is bespoke; consider documenting the gradient and providing a few presets.
- Error paths: When microphone permission is denied, Start button remains disabled until refresh—could improve UX by re-enabling and displaying a retry message.
- Device enumeration message is set in status only on catch; could be surfaced earlier if permissions are not granted.

## Performance
- Offscreen canvas scroll-and-draw pattern is efficient.
- AnalyserNode read and mapping are O(N) per row; reasonable for typical FFT sizes.
- For very large FFTs (>32768), the code mentions a custom FFT path in the top comment, but the current implementation caps to 32768. If custom FFT is planned, it’s not implemented yet.
- Hidden tab handling queues rows to avoid DOM work; a periodic interval keeps limited progress—sensible. Consider clamping queue growth more aggressively or switching to a drop-new strategy to reduce memory when hidden for long periods.

## Accessibility
- Index now includes a noscript message. UI elements are standard controls with labels.
- Consider adding ARIA live region for status updates and ensuring sufficient contrast for text overlay on the canvas.

## Security and Privacy
- Uses getUserMedia for audio; no data is transmitted. Make privacy considerations explicit in README.
- Persisted settings do not include sensitive data—OK.

## Maintainability
- Single large JS file (≈800 lines). Consider splitting into modules if further features are added (renderer, engine, ui).
- Add TypeScript or JSDoc types more broadly for better editor support.

## Testing
- No automated tests. Given it’s a browser visual app, add lightweight smoke tests if introducing build tooling.

## Notable Fixes in This Review
- Fixed HTML structure and metadata in `index.html`, with better indentation and semantics.
- Corrected a missing semicolon in `colormap` and in the hidden-tab interval setup.
- Added `README.md` with clear usage instructions.

## Actionable Items
1. Extract repeated numeric constants to top-level consts for axes and layout.
2. Improve error handling for denied mic access (re-enable Start, provide help text).
3. Consider adding an optional color map selector and document the existing map.
4. Add simple module structure or TypeScript for scalability if the project grows.
5. Add accessibility enhancements (ARIA live region for status; keyboard focus styles).
